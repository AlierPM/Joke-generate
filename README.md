# Webpack Boilerplate:

"This is an exercise to build a simple yet powerful webpack boilerplate, which I will later use as a starting point in all my projects. I followed the webpack official guides,to implement these installations and configuration.

## Webpack App Starter
Frontend environment for building JavaScript applications

Includes the following features...

Babel Loader
Sass Loader With Dart Sass
HTMLWebpackPlugin
WebpackDevServer
Asset Resource Loader
Source Maps
Caching

## Usage
> Run Dev Server (Port 3000)

        npm run dev

## Build for production
        npm run build

## Demo App [Joke Generator](https://alierpm.github.io/Joke-generate/dist/index.html)
The demo app is a very simple Joke generator. Replace with your own code and install other packages as needed
  * index.js (main javascript)
  * template.html (template)
  * styles/main.scss (styles)
